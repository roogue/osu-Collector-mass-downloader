### Explaination

> **parallel**
>
> - `true` Download multiple beatmap sets at the same time.
> - `false` Download only one beatmap set at a time.

> **concurrency** (DO NOT CHANGE IF YOU ARE NOT SURE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING)
>
> - The number of downloads to request at a time.
> - Range: 0 - 10
> - It is recommended to set this to a low number (such as 5) to prevent abuse of the osu!mirror API and getting potential IP bans or rate limits.

> **intervalCap** (DO NOT CHANGE IF YOU ARE NOT SURE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING)
>
> - The maximum number of downloads to request in one minute.
> - Range: 0 - 120
> - It is recommended to set this to a low number (such as 50) to prevent abuse of the osu!mirror API and getting potential IP bans or rate limits.

## FAQ

### It says "Retrying" during the download process, am I doing anything wrong?

> It is normal for API requests to sometimes fail due to factors such as rate limiting and internet connection issues. The script has a built-in retrying process that will handle these issues automatically. It is expected to see the "Retrying" message during the download process.

### I want the beatmaps to be automatically added to my collections. Is that possible?

> Unfortunately, this feature will not be implemented as directly modifying your personal osu! folder is risky and could potentially result in corrupted files. It is recommended to use [Collection Manager](https://github.com/Piotrekol/CollectionManager) (CM) by Piotrekol to modify your collection for more stable functionality.

### Why won't my program even start? The program shuts off right after I opened it.

> There could be several reasons why your program is not starting. One potential cause is that you have incorrectly edited the config file, such as forgetting to include double quotes around the directory path. If you are not sure what the problem is, try reinstalling the program.

### The program freezes in the middle of the process without displaying any error messages. What can I do?

> It can be due to the program is waiting for the next burst of download requests to prevent unwanted rate limits or IP bans. You can also try pressing Enter on your keyboard to see if that prompts the program to continue. This can sometimes happen if you accidentally clicked on the terminal window, which can cause the program to pause.

### Iâ€™ve reached my daily download limit. How can I get the remaining beatmaps?

> You can use [Collection Manager](https://github.com/Piotrekol/CollectionManager) (CM) by Piotrekol along with the generated .osdb file to download the missing beatmaps. Alternatively, you can wait until the limit resets the next day.

### I accidentally downloaded the wrong collection. How can I stop the downloads?

> To stop the downloads, you can simply close the terminal window. This will terminate the program. Alternatively, you can try pressing CTRL+C on your keyboard, which will send a signal to the program to stop running.
